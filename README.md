**FOLDERS**

  **colab_notebooks**
   All notebooks with the code are published in the colab_notebooks folder. Please copy them and try to run.
   I'm happy to hear any idea to improve the code or just that you find this work useful.

  **static**
   Some colab notebooks have dumps of graphs to the JSON format (Plotly), which is inserted to the website.
  
  **yt_videos_colabs**
    Sometimes there is a redacted version (normally, easier and smaller) of a main colab from an article, that I use in videos on the [PythonInvest YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg).
